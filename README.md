# Let's Procrastinate

> The story of how a simple website went from using only passwords to deploying passkeys.

![Passwords to passkeys](./media/intro.png)

Moving to [FIDO2 passkeys](https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/) is a _journey_! It's not realistic to assume your existing users will jump right in. But you don't want to slow down your early adopters either.

This sample demonstrates a realistic crawl/walk/run migration from passwords to passkeys. The migration unfolds like a story with chapters. Each chapter is represented with a `git` branch üòé.

You can navigate to each chapter in a couple of ways:

- If you're just browsing using Github.com, you can jump to a different chapter by using Github's UI to [switch branches](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/making-changes-in-a-branch/managing-branches-in-github-desktop#switching-between-branches).
- We also provide links ‚û°Ô∏è in each README to easily jump to the next chapter.
- If you want to get the most out of this sample, clone the repository locally so you can `git checkout` the desired branch and witness the changes in the code.

Ok! So to get started, turn to [**Chapter 0 ‚û°Ô∏è**](https://github.com/twistedstream/lets-procrastinate/tree/0_only-passwords) where we introduce the password-only backstory of our website:

```shell
git checkout 0_only-passwords
```

Then follow the new README.
